Discord Bot with PaLM API Integration
This project involves the development of a Discord bot that leverages Google's PaLM API to provide multiple functionalities. The bot is capable of explaining code snippets, summarizing text, and delivering inspirational quotes on demand. It is designed to be a helpful assistant within Discord, making it easier for users to get quick explanations or summaries directly in their chat. The bot is deployed on Render Cloud services, ensuring it is always accessible and responsive.
